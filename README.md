# Share-Link-Cleaner

## Description

A tool to remove tracking parameters from share links.

## Supported Platforms

- YouTube
- Bilibili
  - Permission of clipboard content is required to get timestamp.

## Known Issues

- YouTube
  - After closing the Youtube sharing window and reopening it by clicking the share button, the copy button cannot be captured, resulting in it not working.
- Bilibili
  - The short URL `b23.tv` is not working for timestamp. I currently prefer the latter between short URLs and timestamps.
